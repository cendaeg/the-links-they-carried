# the-links-they-carried
###I had way too many bookmarks for services that I thought looked useful. They have now been extrapolated into a Git repo. Feel free to add to this list with pull requests!

**I have not read most of these links to completion. They are taking up room in my bookmarks, so I wanted to put them here! If you would like to discuss the links posted, feel free to add an "issue" to the repo! It's a great way to get some discussion about the links!**
